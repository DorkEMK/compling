Таким образом, максимальное пересечение слов контекста, в котором употреблено слово с разными определениями и примерами из WordNet недостаточно велико и не может являться хорошим дискриминативным признаком для определения значения."

       " 'In the picture you can see the cross hatching. This is caused from the honing operation and helps the rings \"seat\" during the break in process. When the term \"seat\" is used, it means the ring is worn down slightly, allowing it to mate to the cylinder wall, and form a seal which holds compression in the cylinder/combustion chamber, as well as keeping oil out. A secondary purpose of boring the cylinder is to ensure it is completely round. To do this correctly, the shop should use a torque plate, which is attached to the deck during boring and final honing. This simulates the head being attached to the block during the process, so when the head is finally attached, all the little variances are accounted for and the cylinder is as close to round as can be made. \\n',\n",
       " 'An Indian Protest for Everyone By DAVID TREUER Photo Demonstrators near the Standing Rock reservation protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline. Credit Stephanie Keith/Reuters Every protest contains a contradiction: people stand up — through speech, demonstration, violent or nonviolent action — and urge the state to change. They break the rules in order to convince the rule-makers that they need to change the rules, which is itself a kind of state-approved process. However, at Standing Rock in North Dakota, Indians from all over North America have been protesting for seven months in some ways never before seen. Protest in this case is related to process. The Dakota Access Pipeline — a nearly 1,200-mile-long pipeline from the Bakken oil fields in northwestern North Dakota to Illinois — has been in the works for some time. Part of the process was for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the agency that approved the pipeline, to consult with tribes about how the pipeline would affect their reservations and treaty lands, sacred sites and cultural areas. According to documents filed in federal court, the Corps did just that numerous times. In response, officials adjusted the pipeline route. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe chose not to fully engage with pipeline officials until late in the process. When it did, a tribal official declared that the tribe objected to “any kind of oil pipeline construction through our ancestral lands.” Here is where the tribe’s legal battle against the pipeline and the protest diverge. The Standing Rock Sioux sought an injunction on the basis of federal laws protecting the tribe’s interest in preserving sacred sites. The protest, called the Mni Wiconi, or “water is life,” demonstration, is primarily over the danger the pipeline poses to drinking water for everyone. Continue reading the main story The legal and ethical argument is about tribal sovereignty and the protection of natural resources. There is nothing new about such issues. However, what is novel is that the tribe and the outside protesters are working together. The Standing Rock reservation set up a protest camp and made a stand with the protesters. By September, more than 300 tribes — including my tribe, the Ojibwe — were physically represented at the protest camp, at the confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri Rivers. \\n',\n",
